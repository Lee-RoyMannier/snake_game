<h1>Snake Game</h1>

<h2>Snake is a video game genre where the player maneuvers a growing line that
becomes a primary obstacle to itself.

<h2>The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. 
As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. 
In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake 
continually gets longer as it moves. In another common scheme, the snake has 
a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from 
the head. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, 
other obstacle, or itself.
